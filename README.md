# Sports-Pass

This website allows students to resell their sports passes for football games at Texas A&M University. Students can create posts to provide information about their Sports Pass and how they wish to be contacted for potential inquiries. The frontend was developed using ReactJS, Javascript, and CSS. The backend uses AWS, specifically DynamoDB for data storage, API Gateway to set up API calls to the database, and Lambda Functions to define API endpoint behavior.
